The default version of this patch is for the original Organelle (Organelle 1). This version accounts for the RAM in the Organelle 1 but will work on both Organelle 1 and Organelle M. It can record four 96-second loops (8 bars @ 20 BPM). 

There is another version designed for the Organelle M which can record four 240-second loops (20 bars @ 20 BPM). To utilize the Organelle M version: 

1. Delete the current instance of 'main.pd'.
2. Duplicate the 'main-ogm.pd' file and rename to 'main.pd'.
3. Reload patch.
