DJ Patch Record is a 'beat-juggling' sample looper. It loops one of ten of your recorded samples. The fun part is that this patch places two independent playheads on the looping sample. Change the relative position and playback speed of the second playhead to the master playhead for phasing, echo, simultaneous forward & backward playback, and detuned effects. Knob3 sets the master playhead speed (-200% to +200%). Knob4 sets the second playhead speed (-200% to +200%). The keys set the position of the second playhead in relation to the master. Knob1 selects from 10 different samples of your recordings. Knob2 is a steep crossfader modeled after battle dj-mixers. A quick press on the Aux/Footswitch starts and stops playback. A long press will record enable a new track.
